    <h2>Scary <img src="https://cdn-icons-png.freepik.com/128/16315/16315647.png"></h2>
    <p>Dimly lit and dusty, shadows linger. A group of four friends—JESS, MARK, EMMA, and RYAN—explores the eerie cabin.</p>
    <h2>Comedy</h2>
    <p>In the lively **Baking Tent**, JERRY, the clumsy but cheerful contestant, is eagerly preparing to make the best cake ever. Excitedly mixing ingredients, he accidentally grabs "Baking Soda" instead of "Baking Powder," and as he stirs, the mixture bubbles over and EXPLODES, splattering dough all over SARAH, the serious baker next to him. As laughter erupts from the other kids, JERRY, covered in sticky goo, tries to salvage the moment by proudly showing off his silly, blob-shaped “dough animals.” When a kid jokingly calls them "dough-mestic animals," JERRY grins and shrugs, saying, “At least it’s not burned!” The tent fills with giggles, making it the funniest bake-off ever!</p>
    <h2>Drama <img src="https://cdn-icons-png.freepik.com/128/16315/16315647.png"></h2>
    <p>In a small, isolated coastal town, **"Shadows of the Past"** unfolds with EMMA, a young woman grappling with the haunting memories of her estranged father's unexpected death. As she returns home for the funeral, she discovers a series of hidden letters revealing a complicated history between her father and her late mother, who was a celebrated artist. Torn between anger and longing, EMMA embarks on a journey to confront the truth about her family's past, uncovering secrets that challenge her perceptions of love and forgiveness. Along the way, she reconnects with an old childhood friend, NOAH, whose support helps her navigate the emotional turmoil. As they work together to piece together her mother's unfinished art, EMMA learns to confront her grief and mend the fractured relationships that shaped her life, leading to a powerful and cathartic reconciliation with her family's legacy. The film crescendos with a heart-wrenching climax that tests her newfound strength and ultimately reveals the healing power of art and connection.</p>
